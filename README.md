# ConferenceVotingSMS

This is a Google AppEngine application, written in Go, that allows you to collect feedback from conference attendees about the sessions they've attended.  

People simply send an SMS that includes the session number, a rating and a message for the organizers!  

I originally built this for my friend Christopher Schmitt for his CSS Conferences.  It worked so well the first year that we used it again! 

Thanks, Chris, for being an inspiration and a friend.  Miss you, bud.
